# Chuma Oyigbo  
**Security Engineer | ML Engineer | Detection Systems | LLMs at Scale**

Welcome — I specialize in building intelligent, high-impact detection systems that scale across enterprise infrastructure. My work sits at the intersection of security engineering, machine learning, and distributed systems.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- **Security Engineering @ Scale**  
  Architected a detection system at Point72 that processes **2TB+ daily logs**, surfaces **real-time privilege misuse**, and launched **SOC investigations** during live presentations.

- **Machine Learning in Production**  
  Developed an unsupervised anomaly detection model trained on **100M+ auth logs** — now used for **dynamic risk scoring** of internal events at one of the world's top hedge funds.

- **Large Language Model Engineering**  
  Fine-tuned an **8B parameter LLaMA 3.2** model using NYU’s HPC cluster with **tensor/data/pipeline parallelism**, LoRA adapters, and precision tuning across **multi-GPU nodes**.

- **DevOps for High-Reliability Systems**  
  Built and deployed fault-tolerant microservices with **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**, and **Red Hat OpenShift**, handling real-world data integrity and performance at scale.

## 💼 Selected Work

### 🔐 [Service Account Detection System](https://github.com/coyigbo/)  
A real-time detection pipeline used in enterprise production — identifies misuse across thousands of service accounts by analyzing Windows, Linux, and CrowdStrike logs.  
→ **Live policy violations confirmed** during CISO demo.  
→ **Now integrated into SOC workflows.**

### 🧠 [Distributed LLaMA-3.2 Training](https://github.com/coyigbo/distributed-llama-8b-training)  
Fine-tuned an 8B LLM with Slurm scheduling, LoRA, and 8-bit quantization across NYU’s HPC.  
→ Achieved **20%+ training efficiency gains**  
→ Implemented techniques from GPipe, PipeDream, and Tofu

### 🛒 [E-Commerce Order Microservice](https://github.com/CSCI-GA-2820-SP25-003/orders)  
Production-ready REST API service using Flask, Docker, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), and Red Hat OpenShift.
