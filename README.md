# 👋 Hi, I'm Chuma Oyigbo

I'm a Security & ML Engineer-in-Training — currently pursuing my M.S. in Computing, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation at NYU. I build scalable systems that sit at the intersection of cybersecurity, machine learning, and real-time infrastructure.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🏢 **Intern @ Point72**: Engineered detection pipelines and anomaly models that process **2TB+ of daily log data** to monitor service account misuse — resulting in active policy enforcement and live security escalations.
- 🤖 **LLM Researcher**: Fine-tuned an **8B parameter LLaMA 3.2 model** using parallelism (data, tensor, pipeline) on NYU's HPC cluster with LoRA and mixed precision optimizations.
- 🧠 **Security x ML**: My work is focused on combining **detection engineering** and **unsupervised ML** to surface real-world infrastructure risks in enterprise settings.
- 🌐 **Builder**: Created production-ready microservices using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, with strong coverage and clean architecture.
- 🏀 **Athlete-Scholar**: NCAA National Finalist & Honors Court Honoree — balancing technical depth with high-performance teamwork.
